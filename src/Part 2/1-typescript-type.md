# Your first type

Our general rule with TypeScript types is to be as specific and narrow as possible when declaring types. This helps to ensure that consumers know what to pass to your functions and means that you donâ€™t have to do as much defensive programming in your function because the set of possible arguments is smaller.

If your function takes a string but there are only a handful of possible values, then a union of string literals might be a more specific type signature that could be used.

## Basic types

### Strings
```ts
const name: string = 'vong';
```

### Numbers
```ts
const age: number = 300;
```

### Booleans
```ts
const isOld: boolean = false;
```

### Arrays
```ts
const hobbies: string[] = ['eating', 'sleeping', 'breathing'];
```

### Simple Objects
```ts
const menu: Record<string, number> = {
  friedRice: 10,
  friedChicken: 15,
}
```

## Custom types
There are two ways to declare custom types in TypeScript.

1. `type`
```ts
type MenuItem = {
  name: string;
  price: number;
}
```

2. `interface`
```ts
interface MenuItem {
  name: string;
  price: number;
}
```

### What's the difference? ðŸ¤·

#### Extending
For `type`s you extend by
```ts
type BaseMenuItem = {
  name: string;
  price: number;
};

type MilkTeaMenuItem = BaseMenuItem & {
  sugarLevels: string[];
}
```

For `interface`s you extend by
```ts
interface BaseMenuItem {
  name: string;
  price: number;
}

interface MilkTeaMenuItem extends BaseMenuItem {
  sugarLevels: string[];
}
```

`type`s are useful when dealing with generics.

### Which one should I use? ðŸ¤”

Generally, try to use `type`s wherever you can and use `interface`s when you need to extend objects.

## String literals
As the name suggests, these are types where we narrow down the value of a string to literally the value specified.
```ts
type AddRestaurantAction = {
  type: 'ADD_RESTAURANT';
  payload: {
    name: 'KFC',
    address: '123 Chicken Street',
    priceRange: '$'
  };
};
```

## Union Types
`type`s are useful when you want to declare union types like:
```ts
type ActionType = 'ADD_RESTAURANT' | 'DELETE_RESTAURANT';
```

### Avoid Less Specific

```ts
function updateJobStatus(jobId: string, status: string): void {
  ...
}
```

### Preferred More Specific

```ts
type JobStatus = 'draft' | 'published' | 'closed' | 'archived';

function updateJobStatus(jobId: string, status: JobStatus): void {
  ...
}
```
